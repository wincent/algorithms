# Usage

Open `index.html` in Chrome (other browsers may work, but they probably won't; I only bothered making this work in Chrome seeing as it is just a quick demo).

The "Show Seam" and "Remove Seam" buttons use vertical seams by default. Hold down `Shift` to make them use horizontal seams instead.

# Known issues

-   Horizontal seams work by transposing the image data, which is avoidable; a "real" implementation would do this without transposing.
